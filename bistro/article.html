        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
        <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i xml:lang="fr">sous vide</i></dfn>. [cite: 7]</p>
        
        <p>In <i xml:lang="fr">sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. [cite: 8]</p>
        
        <p>In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q> [cite: 9]</p>

        <p>Next month, we will be serving <i xml:lang="fr">Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. [cite: 9]</p>
